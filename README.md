Project Statement:

The Guesser Game is a simple number guessing game implemented in an object-oriented manner. In this game, there are four key entities: a Guesser, three Players, and an Umpire. The Guesser selects (guesses) a secret number, and each Player is given a chance to guess the same number. The Umpire is responsible for collecting the guesses from the Guesser and the Players, comparing them, and declaring the result. If one or more Players correctly guess the number chosen by the Guesser, they are declared winners. The game emphasizes basic object-oriented concepts such as class creation, object interaction, encapsulation, and control structures.
